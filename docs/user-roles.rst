Organization roles
==================

An *organization admin* can add users to and remove users from an organization.
Admins can perform all available operations for projects and services. They
have access to the organization's Audit Log.

Each organization must have at least one admin.

An *organization member* is able to view the list of organization users but
can't edit, add, or remove users.

They only have access to projects they are part of.


.. _project-roles:

Project roles
=============

A *project admin* can add users to and remove users from a project. They can
also perform every available operation inside that project.

.. NOTE::

    This means that an *organization member* who is also a *project admin* can
    perform all available operations within that project, but not within the
    organization.

A *project member* has read-only access to the project.
